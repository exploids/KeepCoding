# Keep Coding and Nobody Explodes

"Keep Coding and Nobody Explodes" is a game _inspired_ by "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes".
It has been developed as part of a module at my university, where every student developed one of the modules for the game.
This repo only contains the framework of the game, along with a module that is solved by arranging shapes according to some pre-defined rules.
